## About
I designed and built this website with Vue.js and Webpack because I feel like it's weird when web developers don't have... websites. It's hosted, served and continuously deployed as a static bundle through Netlify.

I care about privacy so this website doesnt track you or set cookies, it doesn't request any third party assets or libraries, it makes no API requests, and it's fully functional with or without JavaScript.
